# temperature_prediction
Project for Machine Learning Course in Poznan University of Technology


The main goal of the project was to predict the room temperature and the degree of valve opening on the basis of data from the 7 days preceding the test day. Prediction took place every 15 minutes.

Results from an example test day:

Results on my test set:
- temperature: 0.05 °C
- valve 4%


Results on the test set of the teacher:
- temperature: 0.1 °C
- valve 8%
